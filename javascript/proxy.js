// ðŸ”¹ What is a Proxy Object in JavaScript?
// A Proxy in JavaScript is an object that wraps another object (called the "target") and intercepts operations like getting, setting, or deleting properties.

// ðŸ”¹ Think of it as a "middleware" for objects.
// ðŸ”¹ You can customize behavior when someone accesses or modifies properties.


const secret = { password: "1234", username: "user1" };

const securityProxy = new Proxy(secret, {
  has: (obj, prop) => {
    return prop !== "password"; // Hides 'password' from `in` operator
  }
});

console.log("username" in securityProxy); // true
console.log("password" in securityProxy); // false

//hide from password
